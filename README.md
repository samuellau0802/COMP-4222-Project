# COMP-4222-Project

## Topic:
**Graph Neural Network in recommending venture capital investments for startups and investors**
### Background:
Investors and venture capitalists want to invest in startups through venture capital investments. However, due to limited resources and information, startups may not be able to find interested investors; while investors might not be aware that some startups are raising funds or selling their shares. Therefore, there is a need to match the sellers with possible buyers by recommending different startups for investors, and vice versa.

### Goal:
Build a recommendation system to match the startup companies and investors

### Methodology:
We structure this question into a bipartite graph ùê∫ = (ùëà, ùëâ, ùê∏). The set U refers to the investors / funds, while V refers to startups. Our goal is to predict whether deals (links) would occur between investors and startups, formulating a link prediction problem.
We would also include some features which affect the decision of investors or startups. For example, investors' background, as well as their previous invested industries would be treated as the node properties of U. The startup industries, deal size, deal round, etc. would be considered as the node properties of V. We would also
consider previous deal transactions, which act as the links for training data.

## Data:
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/startup-investments
* Raw data CSVs
    * [link](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/cmslau_connect_ust_hk/EliRyyIOmHJPjvnQSazTQuYBftxnTFjv0UmRHQSNlLdxqw?e=pGdIgk)

* Raw data is preprocessed through */preprocessing/data_formatting.ipynb* *

* Data then is formatted and stored under the folder */data*

#### Stats
* Number of Nodes (25446)
    * Investors: 7594
    * Startups: 17852
* Number of Edges (45621)

## File Structure
### Data
* Store formatted csv
### Preprocessing
* Notebook for preprocessing raw data
### raw_data
* Store raw data

### utils
* Under */utils*, there are 4 sub-folders including:
1. *CustomMetrics.py*: functions to compute loss and auc
2. *CustomUtilities.py*: functions to generate the positive and negative graph. Also used to perform train, test, val split.
3. *PredictorClasses.py*: contains DotPredictor and MLPPredictor
4. *startup_data_set.py*: includes dataset class

### model training notebooks
* ChebyshevGCN

## Further Direction
1. Overfitting Problem
    * Overfitting occurs even a high dropout rate (0.8) is added in several models. In the future, more normalization techniques could be added.
2. VGAE 
    * Underfitting occurs due to the resources and time we have, we are unable to continue the training.
